## Goal

By the Godot documentation, the goal of this project is to create a simple 2D game with the Godot engine. one side learning the engine and the other side learning the game development process.

## Deployment

when we want to share the game with others, we need to export the game. Godot supports exporting the game to different platforms. So quickly we can export the game to web, which is the easiest way to share the game. 

Maybe in the future, we can export the game to other platforms like windows, android, ios, etc. Because the web platform ability is limited. but the long-term goal is to create a complex game. now we use the web platform to begin learning.

> note: we also try the other platforms like windows. but the automatic export to windows have much bugs. so based on the [godot template](https://github.com/D4M13N-D3V/godot_template) project, we easy share our project on the github page.
